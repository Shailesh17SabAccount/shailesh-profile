        <h2> Getting Started with Scribbler</h2>
        <p>
          For those venturing into JavaScript experimentation using Scribbler, here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h1>Sign Up and Installation</h1>
            <p>
              Begin by signing up on the Scribbler platform or accessing it via an online version, eliminating the need for installations. It’s hassle-free, allowing you to focus solely on your code.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h1>Creating a Notebook:</h1>
            <p>
              Once logged in, create your first notebook. You’ll be greeted with a clean interface comprising cells where you can write code, add text, or include visualizations.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h1>Coding and Visualization:</h1>
            <p>
              Experiment with JavaScript by writing code in individual cells. Execute them and observe real-time outputs. Leverage libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to visualize data or concepts directly within the notebook.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h1>Documentation:</h1>
            <p>
              Annotate your code with Markdown cells to explain concepts, add context, or jot down observations. This documentation not only helps you understand your code better but also aids others who might access your notebooks.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h1>Collaboration and Sharing:</h1>
